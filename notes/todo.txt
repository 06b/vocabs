- URLs could be just /css-vocabulary and /html-vocabulary, so they would make sense in any domain, or maybe we want them to be part of a context, like in vocabs.workflower.fi/css/en, yeah, that latter one sounds a lot better
  - Anyway the app shouldn't need any html5 history api trickery, it could just work per loaded url, choosing another vocab would just be clicking a link in a list in the app, instead of a select menu thingy. There would be an index of vocabs in the help screen or something, so you could copy the urls from there directly, and choosing a vocab & language would be behind one link, instead of two select menus. Plus the list could show credits at the same time.
- Optimize speed: less flare, more performance, this app is about code, documentation and learning, not about graphic design
  -> minimize js & css
- Add some light weight analytics
- Favicon
- Build vocabs.json with grunt instead of by hand
