# Vocabs for Webdev

A small app to browse through which is what in html, css and other languages that you, dear web person are kind enough to add. Has some sample code to the left, with a list of terminologu to the right. Clicking on anything in one panel highlights the corresponding items in the other.

The purpose of the app is to follow the specifications closely, always preferring the most recent version of the specs. This is so all items in the vocabularies have strict and verifiable definitions. So some common terminology might be out of scope for the vocabulary list, as many common terms are used loosely or can sometimes mean different things. (Like names of common tricks or techniques, or some such.)

Issues, forks and all manner of feedback welcome! (For a quick conversation, tweet to @sakamies)
