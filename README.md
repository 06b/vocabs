# Vocabs for Webdev

A small app to browse through which is what in html, css and other languages that you, dear web professional are kind enough to create. There's some sample code, with a list of terminology in the sidebar. Clicking on the code highlights relevant terms in the sidebar. Clicking a term in the sidebar highlights relevant parts in the code.

The purpose of the app is to follow specifications closely, always preferring the most recent version of the specs. This is so all items in the vocabularies have strict and verifiable definitions. Some common terminology might be out of scope for the vocabulary list, as many common terms are used loosely or can sometimes mean different things. (Like names of common tricks or techniques, or some such.)

Issues, forks and all manner of feedback welcome! If you improve the javascript and send a pull request, please try to keep the code boneheadedly simple and understandable.
